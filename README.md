# Photomosaic-Creator
This full-stack application takes in images and makes them into photomosaics using a choice of image database selections. 
This back-end was created in Python using PIL for image processing. Color quantization techniques and efficient image searching algorithms were implemented to minimize runtime and and maximize color representation accuracy. The web interface was built in HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript using the Flask web framework to integrate the front end and back end.

Using Git Bash, this application is deployed onto Heroku. It is available at the following link: https://make-a-photomosaic.herokuapp.com/ (images above 1080p may have runtime issues). However, Heroku's limitations prevent entire image databases from being utilized. This means that using the website version will result in less detailed mosaics.
Download the code and run it yourself for the best outcomes.
