# Photomosaic-Creator
This application takes in images and makes them into photomosaics using a choice of image database selections. 
This application was created in Python using PIL for image processing. 
The web interface was built in HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript using the Flask web framework to integrate the front end and back end.

# Website

Using Git Bash, this application is deployed onto Heroku.
It is available at the following link: https://make-a-photomosaic.herokuapp.com/
However, Heroku's limitations prevent entire image databases from being utilized. This means that using the website version will result in less detailed mosaics.
Download the code and run it yourself for the best outcomes.
